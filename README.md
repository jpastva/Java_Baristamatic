This program is designed to simulate an automatic coffee dispenser, called the Baristamatic. 
It maintains an inventory of drink ingredients, and is able to dispense a fixed set of possible
drinks by combining these ingredients in different amounts. It also determines the total cost of
a drink based on its component ingredients. Drink selections are made by selecting a number (1-6),
which corresponds to a drink displayed on the menu. Ingredients are depleted with each drink dispensed,
and the updated inventory of ingredients is displayed after each drink selection. Ingredients can 
be refilled by entering 'R' or 'r.' Exit the program by entering 'Q' of 'q.'
